Managing Subscriptions
======================

Upon each successful subscription or unsubscription event, Django Newsletters sends a signal. This allows you to connect outside services.

Both signals provide the same two arguments: email and newsletter. The sender is always the newsletter.

.. code-block:: python

	from newsletters.signals import subscription, unsubscription

	def print_subscription(sender, email, newsletter, *args, **kwargs):
	    print "Subscription Event!"
	    print email, newsletter

	subscription.connect(print_subscription)

	def print_unsubscription(sender, email, newsletter, *args, **kwargs):
	    print "Unsubscription Event!"
	    print email, newsletter

	unsubscription.connect(print_unsubscription)
