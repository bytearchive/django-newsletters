TWT Newsletters
===============

Django TWT Newsletters manages subscriptions to one or more newsletters.

It does not manage the content, but provides ways for producers to link content to newsletters. Delivery of the newsletters is provided through a pluggable backend, allowing integration with outside services

Users can manage the newsletters they get, without registering. A confirmation e-mail is sent each time a change is made.
